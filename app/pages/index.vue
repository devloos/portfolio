      I'm a software engineer with a big passion for Computer Science. My journey started
      back in 2020, but it wasn't until late 2021 that I could fully focus on it. Once I
      got started, I dove into learning C++ through online tutorials and built projects

      Now, I'm studying Computer Science at Long Beach State University and keeping up a
      3.85 GPA. Being the first in my family to go to university makes it all the more
      rewarding.

      While working as a supervisor at Ethika, my interest in tech really took off. I
      started sharing what I was learning, and that led to landing my first software
      development job, a huge moment for me.

      I'm all about learning new things and trying out different tools. Outside of coding,
      I love fishing, playing soccer, and spending time with my family. My dream is to
      create something meaningful that makes a difference, no matter how big or small.
