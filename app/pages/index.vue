      I'm a software engineer who thrives on building modern, scalable web applications.
      My journey started in 2020 with C++ side projects like a

        <span class="underline underline-offset-2">Snake Game</span>

      and a

      >
        <span class="underline underline-offset-2">terminal-based POS system</span>
      </a>
      , which taught me low-level problem solving and memory management early on.

      In 2021, I shifted my focus to the web. I immersed myself in Vue.js, Nuxt, Supabase,
      and TypeScript. Building full-stack apps, shipping features end-to-end, and learning
      to design for scale. Today, I'm pursuing my B.S. in Computer Science at Long Beach
      State with a 3.85 GPA, while working professionally as a Full-Stack Developer.

      At Ethika, I moved from operations into engineering, leading projects that improved
      site performance, cut search costs, and powered large-scale content systems. On the
      side, Iâ€™ve launched a platform called The Inked Network used by 200+ artists,
      integrating real-time features, AI tools, and secure data policies.

      I enjoy working in all areas from performance tuning to crafting clean UI. I
      constantly push myself to pick up new technologies and patterns. Outside of tech,
      you'll find me fishing, playing soccer, or spending time with family.
